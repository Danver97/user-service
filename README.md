# user-service
A simple and basic user microservice. Created using ExpressJs and tested using assert, mocha and supertest.
Right now it's under development so a big part of it it's mocked in order to get a reliable service before for further expansions.
In particular it relies on an in-memory mocked event store database.
No events communication it's implemented yet.
